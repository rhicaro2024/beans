        <p>My website will be all about anything and everything about beans. I will be creating content regarding the history of beans, its popularity as a food, place in pop culture and place in cultres as a whole. There will be a page pretaining to the bean's place within the cooking industry, as well as pages that tell the history of beans in our world. Other pages include popculture which include mr.bean and his character/movies and even celebrities that have some sort of relationship with beans. I plan to also include statistics regarding beans' popularity as a whole.</p>
